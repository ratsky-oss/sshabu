```bash
brew install ratsky-oss/taps/sshabu
```
> Or download binary and move in $PATH by yourself
> - Download the binary file `sshabu`. You can view them on > the release page:

> ```
> - Unzip and move binary file `sshabu` to `/usr/local/bin/`.
> ```bash
> mkdir sshabu_Darwin_arm64 && tar -xvzf sshabu_Darwin_arm64.> tar.gz -C sshabu_Darwin_arm64 && \
>   cd sshabu_Darwin_arm64 && \
>   mv sshabu /usr/local/bin/sshabu
> ```
2. Initialize your sshabu configuration.
```bash
sshabu init
```
3. Enable auto-completion. Several options are available; use the following command to view them:
```bash
sshabu completion --help
```
4. Begin editing the config with this convenient command:
```bash
sshabu edit
```
5. Connect to servers by specifying the name.
```bash
sshabu connect <Name>
```
6. Yep-Yep-Yep! It's time for shabu!

# Installation
## Brew
1. Adding Ratsky third-party repository 
```bash
brew tap ratsky-oss/taps
```
2. Installing sshabu
```
brew install sshabu
```
3. Validate sshabu binary
```
which sshabu
```
4. Initialize your `sshabu` configuration.
```bash
sshabu init
```
## Easy
1. Download the binary file `sshabu` to `/usr/bin/sshabu`. You can change the default path from `/usr/bin/sshabu` to your own, but make sure that the path is included in your `PATH` environment variable.
<!-- ```bash
wget -O /usr/bin/sshabu https://git.ratsky.ru/ratsky/ssh-client/sshabu/-/jobs/2334/artifacts/download?file_type=archive
``` -->
2. Initialize your `sshabu` configuration.
```bash
sshabu init
```
## Build from source
1. Clone the git repository.
<!-- ```bash
git clone https://git.ratsky.ru/ratsky/ssh-client/sshabu.git
``` -->
2. Change the directory to the cloned project.
```bash
cd ./sshabu
```
3. Build the project.
```bash
go build .
```
4. Move the binary file `sshabu`. You can change the default path from `/usr/bin/sshabu` to your own, but make sure that the path is included in your `PATH` environment variable.
```bash
mv sshabu /usr/bin/sshabu
```
5. Initialize your `sshabu` configuration.
```bash
sshabu init
```

## Commands

#### `sshabu init`
Create `~/$HOME/.sshabu/` directory and generate example `sshabu.yaml` config
#### `sshabu apply`
Generate `openssh.config` based on `sshabu.yaml`
#### `sshabu edit`
Open `sshabu.yaml` with editor and runs `sshabu apply after that`
#### `sshabu connect`
Runs openssh command with `openssh.config`

> Find out more info by using `--help` flag

## Configuration

All unmentioned options will be inherited from parent(s) groups 'till top group in <Group> derictive

> ~/.sshabu/sshabu.yaml

Config structure

```
GlobalOptions:
    <Option>

Groups:
    [- <Group>] 

Hosts:
    [- <Host>]
```


### \<Host>

Target of ssh configuration

> All \<Host>.Name(s) must be unique

```
Name: <string>
<Option>
```
Name field is an identifire of following config. \
Name field value will be used as "Host" derective in final Openssh config, if no "Host" option in <Host> is defined.

### \<Group>

Groups allow you to define some options for all included entities such s \<Host> in "Hosts" and \<Group> in "Subgroups".

 Groups was designed to provide option inheritance

 Option precedence list (higher option will override lower):
 - \<Host>.option
 - \<Group>.\<Host>.option
 ...
 - \<Group>.\<Group>....option
 ...
 - GlobalOption

```
Name: <string>
Hosts:
    - [<Host>]
Options:
    <Option>
Subgroups:
    - [<Group>]
```

### \<Option>

Generally just openssh config options in "key: value" format\
man page - ssh_config(5)
https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config \

> Avoid using 'Host' option unless you know what you are doing.  

```
HostName: <str>
IdentityFile: <str>
StrictHostKeyChecking: <yes/accept-new/no/off/ask>
...
```
> Suggestion - "Host" better be unique if used \
> Considerations: \
> Host wildcards?? \
> Using "Host" inside:
> - "GlabalOptions" is useless
> - "\<Host>" will override \<Host>."Name" section in destination openssh config
